# PopularMoviesStage1
Stage 1 of Udacity's Android Development Course.

Note: It is illegal to share my personal themoviedb.org API key so I wrote a placeholder for the constant API\_KEY app/src/main/java/com/example/mkim123/popularmovies/FetchMovieInfo.java.
To get the app working, you need to create an account and request an API key at the following link: https://www.themoviedb.org/account/signup.
